# sxsw data scrape

This Python program was created to export data from the [2019 SXSW schedule](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/events/track/Design).

It was developed in conjunction with the Spring 2019 Typography II [festival schedule assignment](http://cdgd-230-02-sp19.courses.baizman.com/festival-schedule-print.html).
